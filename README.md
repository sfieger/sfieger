- 👋 Hi, I’m @sfieger
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of different things. At the moment: ArchLinux, Java
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use ArchLinux with Xmonad and customizing it together with Xmobar, dmenu, st and other software. Ultimate goal is to get comfortable with ArchLinux, so I can abbandon Windows in the not so distant future... One problem to solve: How to play my favorite games.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me: neefts19@gmail.com - but that only gets read oncl or twice a month...
